# CodeChallenge
My Java solution to http://sortable.com/challenge/.
(1) Download all the java files, txt files and the run.sh, put them into same folder 
(2) run chmod to grant execute permission for run.sh
(3) run the run.sh script

Basic Idea:
I use regular expression to match the model and the manufacturer of the product with the listings. Current regular settings have few false matches but most of the results are correct.
